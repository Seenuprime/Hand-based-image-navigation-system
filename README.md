🖐️ Hand-Based Image Navigation System

🚀 A gesture-controlled image viewer powered by MediaPipe and OpenCV, allowing users to swipe, zoom, and adjust brightness using only hand gestures—no mouse or keyboard needed!
🎯 Features

✅ Swipe to Change Images 👉👈 (Raise index & middle fingers, fold others)
✅ Pinch to Zoom In & Out 🔍 (Use index & thumb, fold other fingers)
✅ Pinch to Adjust Brightness ☀️ (Use index, middle & thumb, fold others)
🛠 Tech Stack

    Python 🐍
    MediaPipe Hands ✋ (Real-time hand tracking)
    OpenCV 📷 (Image processing)
    NumPy 🔢 (Efficient numerical operations)

🚀 Installation
Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hand-based-image-navigation.git
cd hand-based-image-navigation

Step 2: Install Dependencies
